# Insight 3: Player Efficiency and Its Correlation to Experience

    Goal: Quantify how veteran NBA players with 7+ years of experience demonstrate higher efficiency compared to less experienced players, highlighting their value to team success through optimized roles and production.

Type of Finding:
(Choose one: Statistical, Visualization, or Hypothesis)
Explain why it fits that category in 2–3 sentences. Example: “This is a statistical finding because it relies on measuring trends and comparing averages, not just on visuals.”

Connection to the Hypothesis:
Explain in 3–4 sentences how this insight connects back to your main hypothesis. Does it support the idea that strong bench contributions matter? Does it show no clear relationship (leaning toward the null hypothesis)? Or does it complicate the picture by suggesting another factor is involved?

Why It Matters:
Write 2–3 sentences about why this finding is important for the bigger project. Example: “This matters because it helps show whether role players are truly driving team performance, or if success depends more on starters or star players.”
