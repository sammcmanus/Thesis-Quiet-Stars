# üèÄ Thesis: Quiet Stars ‚Äì INFO-I 492

The project, Quiet Stars, analyzes NBA player and team performance using historical datasets. It integrates per-game stats, advanced metrics, and team summaries to clean, analyze, and model basketball performance trends.

## Hypothesis Statement:
Teams with deeper, more efficient benches finish with higher win percentages and better seeds than teams that lean heavily on a few high-usage or very young players.

# Data Cleaning

<BR>

## Row filtering 

    Keep NBA only: lg == 'NBA'.

    Keep seasons between 2000 and 2025, excluding 2020 and 2021 (due to covid years)

    Drop teams named "2TM" (These represent such as All-Star teams)

    Drop league summary rows: Team Summaries.team != 'League Average'.

<BR>

## Column Standardization

    Rename team columns to a common key abv:

        Advanced.team ‚Üí abv

        Player Per Game.team ‚Üí abv

        Team Summaries.abbreviation ‚Üí abv

    Force types:

        Player Per Game.gs ‚Üí int

        Team Summaries.w ‚Üí int

        Team Summaries.l ‚Üí int

        Advanced.season ‚Üí int

        Player Career Info.from ‚Üí int

<BR>

## Impute values

    Player Per Game: all columns are fillna(0) (Setting any missing percentages, rates, and counts in the per-game table to 0)

<BR>

## Merge
    Merge to one player-team-season table

    Keep only the columns below, then inner-join on ["season","player_id","abv"]:

    From Advanced: season, player_id, abv, per, ts_percent, obpm, dbpm, usg_percent, gs, g

    From Player Per Game: season, player_id, abv, ast_per_game, tov_per_game, mp_per_game

    From Team Summaries: season, abv, w, l, playoffs

<BR>

## Rounding

    Round to 2 decimals: per, ts_percent, obpm, dbpm.

<BR>

## Derived fields

    a2t_perc (Assist-to-turnover ratio): ast_per_game / tov_per_game (if either is set to 0 then a2t_perc is 0), rounded to 2 decimals.   

    Team win % team_win_perc = w / (w + l), rounded to 2 decimals.

<BR>

| Role              | classification                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starter (S)       | Games started ‚â• to 50% and minutes played per game ‚â• 24.5 minutes         |
| Role Player (R)   | Games played is ‚â• 30 and games started < 50% and minutes per game ‚â• 15    |
| Bench Player (B)  | Games played between 15 & 30 and minutes per game >= 10                   |
| Insignificant (I) | All others are considered insignificant and are filtered out.             |

<BR>

    Experience (seasons in league):

    Merge career_info[['player_id','from']] (first season) on player_id (inner).

    experience = season - from (year entered league)

    Drop the temporary from column.

<BR>

## Row exclusion after labeling

    Remove players with role == 'I' (insignificant).

<BR>

## Insight 2 Data Prep

    Input: Data/Processed/player_stats_cleaned.csv

    Keep Role players only: role == 'R'.

    Group by (season, abv) and compute means of: playoffs, per, obpm, dbpm, team_win_perc

    Rename abv ‚Üí team; round per, obpm, dbpm to 2 decimals.

    Rank teams within each season by team_win_perc (descending).

    Split into top_half and bottom_half by median rank count per season.

    Output:
    Data/Processed/top_half.csv
    Data/Processed/bottom_half.csv

## Notes & Implications
    
    Excluding the shortened seasons 2020 & 2021 that was caused by covid.
    
    Multi-team seasons: For players traded mid-season, their stats are aggregated on a per-team basis. This means a player will have a separate record for each team they played on within the same season.

    Blanket fillna(0) on Player Per Game: this sets any missing per-game fields (including percent/rate fields) to zero. This is intentional per code; call it out here to avoid confusion.

    A/T ratio when TO=0: the code sets a2t_perc to 0 when tov_per_game == 0 or ast_per_game == 0, this avoids divide-by-zero.
